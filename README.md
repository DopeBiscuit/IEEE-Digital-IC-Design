# IEEE-Digital-IC-Design
**This repo is for my IEEE Digital IC Design workshop, an introduction to digital design using verilog, and these are my tasks.**


## Lecture 1 - Intro to:
-  Introduction to verilog and it's concurrent behaviour.
-  Syntax, logical operators, arithmetic operators and modules.
-  Gate-level design.
-  Structural design.

## Task 1: 
- **Basic Logic circuits using Gate-level and Structural design**
<hr>

## Lecture 2 - Intro to: 
- <p style="font-weight: 400;">Sequential blocks (always, initial), how to use them, what is the senstivity list.
- Behavioural desgin.
- Testbench files
- .do file / scripting.
- Basic logic units using behavioural desing (Mux, decoders, ALU).
- Parameters.</p>

## Task 2:
-  **Create a 3->8 Decoder with enable.**
-  **N-bit comparator with 3 inputs, there are 2 (2*N) Outputs, outputs are decided according to the task pdt attached.**
<hr>

## Lecture 3 - Intro to:
- <p style="font-weight: 400;">Sequential circuits.
- Using (posedge, negedge).
- Video Graphics Array standards.
- Basic sequential Logic units (D-Latch, D-Flip Flop, T-Flip Flop, 4-bit register with load, up down load coutner).</p>

### Task 3:
- **Creating a VGA Controller, with 640 * 480 @ 60Hz industry standard, this interfaces with the VGA connector forcing a color to the whole screen pixel array using a parameter.**
